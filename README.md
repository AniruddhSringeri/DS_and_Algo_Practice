# DS_and_Algo_Practice
These are some of the programs on Data Structures and Algorithms that I have implemented during practice.
Keep in mind that this is a work in progress. As the repository grows, so will my skill.
In each of the programs, I improve upon the previous program or devise a possibly more challenging solution to the same/different problem. So, you can clearly see my improvement and the development of my skills.
I will be using C, C++.
